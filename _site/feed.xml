        <title>Cómo empezó todo</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Solo para probar si el contenido del blog se puede editar online en prose.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y si que se puede. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Antes de nada, aceptad la invitación al repositorio &quot;memoria&quot; de github que os envié desde la cuenta de rooof-project.

Id a prose.io. Os saldrá que teneis que autorizar a github. Le decís que si. Una vez dentro vereis vuestros repositorios, entre ellos la memoria, y desde aquí podeis editar el contenido como si fuera un word. Los archivos que hay que editar son los que están dentro de la carpeta _post. Los demás no se tocan. Cuidado con el orden de los post, van por orden de fecha, el más reciente saldrá el primero. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hay una cosa a tener en cuenta: cuando entreis a prose.io, en la primera pantalla arriba a la derecha os saldrá un menú para escoger el ususuario, teneis que escoger Rooofproject. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/memoria/img/group.png&quot; alt=&quot;group.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Y después, una vez escogido el repositorio memoria en el siguiente paso, teneis que aseguraos de que el branch es gh-pages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/memoria/img/branch.png&quot; alt=&quot;branch.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Para ver el blog online podeis hacerlo desde el mismo repositorio de github, abajo del todo hay un link que pone &quot;View Live Demo →&quot; o &lt;a href=&quot;http://rooof-project.github.io/memoria&quot;&gt;desde aquí&lt;/a&gt;. Para ver los cambios que habéis hecho refrescad la página, tarda un poquito, quizá tengáis que refrescar 2 o 3 veces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dsbv fvdvA Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;dfasdfsd fdgNever in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Release 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman&#39;s earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there&#39;s no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That&#39;s how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>La identidad de ROOOF</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Proceso de creación&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La identidad de la plataforma también la hemos planteado de manera incremental.
Al trabajar por releases, y tener un tiempo limitado para abarcar todos los aspectos del proyecto (investigación con usuarios, modelo de negocio, arquitectura, soluciones tecnológicas...) nos dimos cuenta que no podíamos invertir desde el principio todo el tiempo que requiere crear una identidad sólida ya que lo primero era crear la plataforma, hacer un prototipo funcional y probarlo para saber qué caminos escoger. Por lo que en un primer momento decidimos hacer lo básico, una identidad mínima, que iría evolucionando a medida que avanzábamos con el proyecto.

&lt;p&gt;En medio de entrevistas con usuarios, design thinking, y análisis de diferentes plataformas empezamos a sentar las bases de los elementos de la identidad: Tipografía, color, fotografía, Naming, logotipo y comunicación. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;El target&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A medida que íbamos avanzando con el proyecto fuimos conociendo mejor al tipo de usuario que usaría la plataforma. Vimos que la mayor parte de nuestros usuarios son gente joven (20-45), personas abiertas, con ganas de conocer gente nueva y compartir sus aficiones y creaciones en eventos desenfadados. Por tanto la identidad planteada tenía que ser informal, divertida, juvenil y cercana.

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Elementos de la identidad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/memoria/img/post-sample-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Sample Image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tipografía&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rooof usa la combinación de tres familias tipográficas, con la intención de crear un ritmo visual mediante el contraste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aparte de los requerimientos de identidad que la propia plataforma nos iba exigiendo, hemos tenido en cuenta aspectos técnicos y económicos para la elección tipográfica:
- Web fonts: Usamos fuentes de google fonts,  por ser de fácil integración en el desarrollo de la plataforma.
- Gratuítas: El dinero es un factor importante. Por lo que optamos por el momento en no gastar dinero en tipografía. Google fonts nos ofrecía un catálogo numeroso de tipografías completamente gratuítas.
- Diferentes pesos tipográficos: Escogimos tipografías con varios pesos,  para que nos diese juego a la hora de crear la identidad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Código tipográfico&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familia Dosis:&lt;/strong&gt; Aunque es la tipografía con más carácter y la que más personalidad aporta no es de fácil lectura por lo que fuimos delimitando su uso para titulares principales y secundarios, equilibrando identidad y legibilidad.
Nos aporta los valores de desfenfado, diversión y juventud  que fuimos detectando en el target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familia PT serif:&lt;/strong&gt;más humanística, nos aporta los valores culturales.  Además como es de fácil lectura la usamos para cuerpos de texto y todo párrafo relaccionado con el contenido que los usuarios irán generando.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Familia PT Sans:** Es una tipografía sin serifa, mucho más técnica y de fácil lectura. La usamos de apoyo con la tipografía principal Dosis, con la intención de crear contraste y ritmo.
También la usamos para la comunicación de la plataforma con los usuarios: Formularios, alertas, mensajes de ayuda,  o datos puramente informativos como fechas, aforo, precios...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hubo un momento que teníamos demasiados pesos tipográficos, que fuimos depurando hasta usar solo tres para la Dosis, y uno para cada una de las PT, mas us versión bold.  Con esto conseguimos unidad en los estilos y eliminar peso inecesario en la web de ROOOF.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
